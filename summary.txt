For my final project, I'm building a character recognition app 
that lets users draw letters or digits on a canvas, saves the drawing with a label, 
and then uses a machine learning model to predict what character was written.

So far, Iâ€™ve written several parts of the program: a "clear" class that resets the drawing area,
a DataEntry class that stores image paths and their labels, 
and a feature to show label counts using a hash table. 
Next, I plan to focus on improving the accuracy of the machine learning model 
by expanding the volume of training data
